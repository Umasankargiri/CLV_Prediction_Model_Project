# 🧠 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Model

**Internship Project – Elevate Labs | Ministry of MSME**

This project uses machine learning to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on customer purchase history, tenure, and total spending. The goal is to identify high-value customers and enable targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict CLV and segment customers into Low, Medium, and High value tiers
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - MAE: ₹354.46
  - RMSE: ₹590.36
- **Segmentation**: Quantile-based using `pd.qcut`
- **Visualization**: CLV distribution plotted using Seaborn

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `CLV_Prediction_Model_UmasankarG.ipynb` – Full code notebook
- `final_clv_segments.csv` – Predicted CLV with customer segments
- `Project_Report.pdf` – 2-page professional report
- `CLV_Distribution.png` – CLV distribution visualization (optional)

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Majority of customers fall into the Low CLV segment
- High CLV customers are fewer but drive most revenue
- Tenure and purchase history strongly influence CLV
- Model predictions are stable and segmentation is business-ready
